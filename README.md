# ML-for-plasmas

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures for the paper titled "Foundations of Machine Learning for Low-temperature
Plasmas: Guided Case Studies"

Notes:
* The scripts were run using Google Colab Pro. Using a low-RAM kernel may cause some of the scripts to crash.
* The data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gTh484SOfPl3Xc1tcYdM-srfCBNjuB9m?usp=sharing. Make sure that the relative paths in your code are set up correctly. The code should work off-the-shelf if the Data folder is placed on the same level as this repository (not inside of it).
* If you are running the script locally, make sure to remove the code for Google Drive mounting.
